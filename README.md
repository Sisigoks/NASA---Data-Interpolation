# NASA-Data-Interpolation
## Overview
- Welcome to the NASA-Data-Interpolation project! This project aims to analyze and interpret data from NASA to identify exoplanets that could potentially be suitable for human habitation, aside from Earth. By leveraging advanced interpolation techniques and data analysis, we aim to determine the Environmental Suitability Index (ESI) and distance of various exoplanets to find the most promising candidates for further exploration.

## Project Objectives
- **Determine Environmental Suitability Index (ESI):** Calculate and assess the ESI of exoplanets based on available data to evaluate their potential habitability.
  
- **Calculate Distance:** Accurately compute the distance of exoplanets from Earth to identify which ones are within a feasible range for future exploration.
  
- **Identify Plausible Candidates:** Highlight exoplanets that exhibit the most favorable conditions for human habitation.

- **Data Acquisition:** Integrates data from NASAâ€™s exoplanet database and other astronomical sources.
  
- **Interpolation Techniques:** Utilizes advanced interpolation methods to estimate missing data points and refine analyses.
  
- **Custom Algorithms:** Employs tailored algorithms to compute ESI and distance metrics based on various parameters.
  
- **Visualization:** Provides visual representations of data to aid in the interpretation and comparison of exoplanetary conditions.
